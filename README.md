# Goby API Documentation (WIP)

This is the API documentation for goby language.

## Contribution

Install dependency:

```nohighlight
go get github.com/russross/blackfriday
```

Run in project root:

```nohighlight
go run *.go
```

That should generate new docs in `/docs` directory. Commit and push them.
